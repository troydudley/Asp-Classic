# Asp-Classic
Asp Classic code examples

These files are source examples for various problems encountered with a legacy .asp classic application.  Some of the choices made with 
how the files are formed are due to environmental considerations; such as, why raw sql is included in the Security.asp file rather than
stored procedures.

Often, time contraints prevented the complete development of the source or only partial refactoring.  Such are the delimas of a production
environment.
